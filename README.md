<h1>Azure User Defined Routes</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab will configure user defined routes.<br /><br />

In Azure, user-defined routes (UDRs) are a feature of the Azure Virtual Network (VNet) that allow you to control the routing of network traffic within your virtual network. By default, Azure provides a basic routing table for your VNets, but sometimes you need more control over how traffic flows, such as routing it through a specific network appliance or directing it to a different subnet.<br/><br/>


</h4> Purpose of User-Defined Routes</h4> <br/><br/>
Custom Routing Paths: You can create routes to direct traffic to a specific virtual appliance, like a firewall or VPN gateway, instead of the default route.<br/><br/>
Control Traffic Flow: Useful for scenarios like enforcing traffic inspection or implementing complex network architectures.<br/><br/>
Override Default Routes: UDRs can override Azureâ€™s default routing, allowing for more precise control over the network traffic.<br/><br/>
